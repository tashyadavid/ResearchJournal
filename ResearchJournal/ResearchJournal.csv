left,Moiré Pattern Art ,"The dot is black, 2018","This was the first time I saw Processing used with audio feedback, and it was so visually enticing, it amazing to see what Processing is capable of. It was kind of hypnotic in a weirdly satisfying way. The moire patterns moved so smoothly, but not in a way that felt too perfect, which actually made it more interesting to watch.
What stood out to me was how something that looks so simple could become so complex and beautiful just through motion and timing. It was interesting to find that the visuals aren’t manually animated — they’re generated through mathematical functions and timed interactions, which makes it feel like the system is designing itself. There’s this really nice balance between precision and unpredictability, and that’s what makes it so mesmerising.",https://64.media.tumblr.com/0279a07690d687564341b0962eed77bf/tumblr_nbzxwnwDZM1tb0c1mo1_1280.jpg,,Generative digital artwork using Processing with audio feedback integration. ,,https://thedotisblack.com/post/771654921435185152/thedotisblack-2014914205647frame0002,"Creative coding, Processing generative art", 
left,Skyline,"Raven Kwok, 2015","This was an amazing piece of generatice digital art. It felt really clean and precise but still dynamic, like everything was moving with purpose. I liked how it played with repetition and symmetry — the visuals felt immersive. What stood out to me was how controlled it was, but it didn’t feel robotic — it felt intentional and designed, like it had its own logic. It made me think differently about how motion and form can be generated. It opened the door to understanding generative visuals as a design tool, not just an aesthetic.",https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5650/21596480462_003c3b3a32_z.jpg,https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/646/21420005988_7496e8018a_z.jpg,Generative digital artwork using Processing with audio feedback integration. ,Generative digital artwork using Processing with audio feedback integration. ,https://ravenkwok.com/skyline/,"Creative coding, Processing generative art",
left,Eat the Rich,"Matt Korostoff, 2020","Pixel Wealth was such a crazy but simple way to show the scale of wealth inequality. Honestly, the simplicity is what made it so impactful for me. I love that it’s literally just pixels and names, but it says so much. It doesn’t over-explain anything, it just lets the scroll do the talking.
It really made me think about how desensitised we are to huge figures. You hear “billions” all the time, but you never actually feel what that looks like, until you’re literally dragging your screen through it for minutes. Sometimes, the most powerful visuals are the ones that just show you the facts and let you sit with them.",ResearchJournal/Img/Eat-the-rich.png,ResearchJournal/Img/eat-the-rich-2.png,Data visualisation of Wealth,Data visualisation of Wealth,https://eattherichtextformat.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/,"Data visualisation, Digital storytelling, Information design",
left,Dear Data,"Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posave,  2014–2015","Dear Data really changed the way I think about data visualisation. I love how Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec turned something so analytical into something emotional and hand-drawn. It made me realise that data doesn’t have to be digital or polished — it can be messy, expressive, and full of feeling.
I also loved how each week’s topic became a kind of personal reflection. It wasn’t just about the numbers, it was about noticing patterns in everyday life and translating them into something meaningful. I find myself thinking about this project a lot, it inspires me to pay more attention to the little correlations in my own everyday life.",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/54eec73ee4b0ae0904da0e94/1469542854799-2365D7LSCDN76OWNNVNB/image-asset.jpeg?format=2500w,,Date Visualisation and Personal Reflection,,https://www.dear-data.com/theproject,"Analog data visualisation, Emotional storytelling, Data as language",
left,Cant help myself,"Sun Yuan and Peng Yu, 2016","Can’t Help Myself was so unsettling but also weirdly captivating. Watching the robotic arm constantly try to contain the red liquid felt like watching something painfully human. It was stuck in this endless loop of cleaning up its own mess. It made me think about control, failure, and how exhausting it is to try and keep everything together.
Even though it’s just a machine, it almost felt alive — like it was tired, frustrated, desperate. I really liked how physical computing was used here to create something so emotional. The whole thing runs on programmed movement and sensors, but the result feels messy and real. It’s one of those works that actually makes people stop and feel something, and I think that’s what makes it so powerful. I remember seeing this piece years ago and I didn’t know the name of it but it still stuck with me. Personifying machines will always be something of great interest to me.",https://www.guggenheim.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016.40_ph_web_2.jpg,,Robotic installation featuring a programmed robotic arm attempting to contain a spreading pool of red liquid.,,https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/34812,"Physical Computing, Robotics",
left,Text Rain,Camille Utterback & Romy Achituv 1999,"Text Rain by Camille Utterback and Romy Achituv really stood out to me. It’s such a poetic way to bring interaction into art. I loved how the falling letters responded to your body. It felt playful, but also meaningful. You’re not just looking at the artwork; you’re in it, shaping it with your presence.
It made me think about how interfaces can be emotional and immersive, not just functional. The idea that you could literally catch words with your body felt so symbolic, like just being there could shift language or meaning. I found it soft, thoughtful, and beautifully done.This was also a big source of inspiration for our final project.",https://camilleutterback.com/wp2022/wp-content/gallery/text-rain/textrain2.jpg,https://camilleutterback.com/wp2022/wp-content/gallery/text-rain/textrain_hands3_640_72dpi.jpg,Interactive installation where falling letters respond to participants’ movements,Interactive installation where falling letters respond to participants’ movements,https://camilleutterback.com/projects/text-rain/,"Interactive art, Projection-based installation, Immersive experience",
left,The Strangers,"Kyung Yun Choi, 2020","The Strangers by Kyung Yun Choi really amazed me, not just conceptually, but technically. I was especially impressed by the use of speech-to-text software, real-time processing, and a microcontroller to control a vintage typewriter. The way your voice was turned into fragmented Morse code, with “I” and “You” removed, felt both distant and deeply symbolic.
It made me reflect on how language can break down, even when we’re trying to connect. This project definitely inspired us, we’re using speech-to-text and real-time interaction in our final project too, and seeing it used so meaningfully here really stuck with me.",https://dam-prod2.media.mit.edu/thumb/2023/03/16/IMG_7365_copy.png.1400x1400.png,,"Real-time speech-to-text transformed into fragmented Morse code, typed by a vintage typewriter",,https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/the-stranger/overview/,"Interactive installation, Speech-to-text processing, Real-time processing, Poetic computing",
left,The Changing Room,"Lauren McCarthy, 2016","An Immersive  installation where you choose an emotion; like “nostalgic” or “envious” and the space transforms to reflect that feeling. It uses sensors to track your movement, facial expressions, and voice pitch, responding in real time with visuals, sounds, and prompts to create a shared emotional atmosphere.
It reminded me a lot of our final project, which made it feel especially inspiring. What I love about installations like this is how they take something internal something we usually keep to ourselves and make it physical and shared. It made me reflect on how emotions aren’t always just personal. This piece turns a feeling into something you can literally step into, and it made me think more deeply about how much our environments and the people around us shape what we feel. In general, I am quite drawn to emotion-driven design.",https://freight.cargo.site/w/2000/q/75/i/7417fa61f0c73a3742dfed23c603a353fc6e0fd1a32fac89641bf2442d98b719/IMG_1212.jpg,https://freight.cargo.site/w/1500/q/75/i/dcd79306942c62a60600e7110005926cec0152da1fa670aaf57ecf5770724674/20210210_OCA_CamMcLeod_0716.jpg,"Real-time sensor-driven environment that transforms based on participants’ chosen emotions, blending visuals, sound, and interaction to externalize and share internal feelings.","Real-time sensor-driven environment that transforms based on participants’ chosen emotions, blending visuals, sound, and interaction to externalize and share internal feelings.",https://lauren-mccarthy.com/The-Changing-Room,"Immersive installation, Real-time interaction, Emotion-driven design",
left,Because Recollection,"Creative Agency 84.Paris, launched in December 2015","I’m genuinely obsessed with Because Recollection. It’s not just a website it’s an interactive sound journey that’s playful, emotional, and beautifully crafted. I’ve never encountered a digital experience quite like it; it made me feel like a kid discovering something entirely new. The seamless integration of music, motion, and interactivity was awe-inspiring. I was especially inspired by their use of WebGL and PixiJS — tools I hadn’t realized could be pushed this far creatively. The user experience was so memorable, and it left me feeling inspired by what’s possible when technology and storytelling come together so intentionally.","https://images.prismic.io/84paris/357787ea36f438f2e5f09f6392859f608ca589c4_because-recollection_work_img_6.jpg?auto=compress,format",,Interactive web-based sound journey using WebGL and PixiJS,,http://because-recollection.com/,"WebGL, Immersive experience, Creative coding, Interactive storytelling",
left,Beyond Resolution,"Rosa Menkman, 2020","This website because it explores several of my favourite visual and conceptual elements — many of which I’ve experimented with in my own work.Specifically, the landing page,  the warped grid that dynamically responds to mouse movement is incredibly satisfying and immersive. As someone fascinated by geometry, black-and-white aesthetics, and interactive visuals, the experience felt especially impactful. It struck a compelling balance between control and chaos, perfectly capturing the tension between order and disruption in a way that felt both intentional and thought-provoking.",ResearchJournal/Img/Beyond-Resolution.png,," Interactive web experience exploring perceptual limits through responsive warped grids, geometry, and black-and-white visuals",,https://beyondresolution.info/,"Generative visuals, Experimental interface",
